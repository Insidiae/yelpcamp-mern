# YelpCamp Remake: MERN Edition

This is the milestone project from Colt Steele's [The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021 course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/). This project deviates from the course lectures by implementing the frontend using React instead of EJS.

## Tech Stack

For the most part, this project follows the tech stack as seen in The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021's final project. The only major difference is that the frontend is not served via the Express backend using EJS, but rather served via a React app.

The full list of technologies used are as follows:

### Backend

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for the database
- [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/) for authentication
- [Joi](https://joi.dev/) for validating incoming data
- [Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/) for securing HTTP requests

### 3rd party applications

- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) for hosting images
- [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) for geocoding and displaying maps

### Frontend

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Router v6](https://reactrouter.com/) for routing
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- [React Slick](https://react-slick.neostack.com/) for displaying an image carousel
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) for interfacing with the backend server
